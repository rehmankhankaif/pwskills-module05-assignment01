    "Ans. 1. Regular Function<br>\n",
    "Definition: Using the def keyword. Call: By name.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "def greet(name):<br>\n",
    "    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "# Calling the function<br>\n",
    "print(greet(\"Alice\"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2. Lambda Function<br>\n",
    "Definition: Using the lambda keyword for small, anonymous functions. Call: By the variable assigned.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "# Defining a lambda function<br>\n",
    "add = lambda x, y: x + y<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "# Calling the lambda function<br>\n",
    "print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "3. Function with Default Arguments<br>\n",
    "Definition: Providing default values for parameters. Call: With or without optional arguments.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "def greet(name, message=\"Hello\"):<br>\n",
    "    return f\"{message}, {name}!\"<br>\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?<br>\n",
    "Ans. The purpose of the return statement in a Python function is to exit the function and send back a value to the caller. It allows the function to produce an output, which can then be used elsewhere in your program. Without a return statement, a function will return None by default.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Example:<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "def add_numbers(a, b):<br>\n",
    "    result = a + b<br>\n",
    "    return result  # This sends the value of result back to the caller<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "# Calling the function and storing the returned value in a variable<br>\n",
    "sum_result = add_numbers(5, 3)<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "# Printing the returned value<br>\n",
    "print(sum_result)  # Output: 8<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Explanation:<br>\n",
    "Function Definition: The add_numbers function takes two parameters, a and b.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Calculation: It calculates the sum of a and b and stores it in the result variable.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Return Statement: The return statement sends the value of result back to where the function was called.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Function Call: When add_numbers(5, 3) is called, it returns 8, which is stored in the sum_result variable.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Output: The print(sum_result) statement outputs 8.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?<br>\n",
    "Ans. Iterables:<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Definition: Objects that can return an iterator. These include data structures like lists, tuples, and strings.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Usage: Can be used in a for loop to iterate over their elements.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Methods: Must implement the __iter__() method.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Example:<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]<br>\n",
    "for item in my_list:  # my_list is an iterable<br>\n",
    "    print(item)<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Iterators:<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Definition: Objects that represent a stream of data. An iterator returns one element at a time.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Usage: Can be used to iterate through an iterable. Once exhausted, it cannot be reset.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Methods: Must implement both __iter__() and __next__() methods.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Example:<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "my_list = [1, 2, 3]<br>\n",
    "iterator = iter(my_list)  # Creating an iterator from the iterable<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "print(next(iterator))  # Output: 1<br>\n",
    "print(next(iterator))  # Output: 2<br>\n",
    "print(next(iterator))  # Output: 3<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Key Differences:<br>\n",
    "Definition and Purpose:<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Iterable: A collection of data that can be iterated over (e.g., list, tuple, string).<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Iterator: An object that helps traverse through an iterable, one element at a time.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Methods:<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Iterable: Implements __iter__() method.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Iterator: Implements __iter__() and __next__() methods.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Exhaustion:<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Iterable: Can be reset by calling the iter() function again.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Iterator: Once exhausted, needs to be recreated to iterate again.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.<br>\n",
    "Ans. Concept: Generators are a type of iterable, like lists or tuples. However, unlike lists, generators do not store all their values in memory. Instead, they generate values on the fly and can be iterated over one at a time, which makes them memory efficient, especially for large datasets.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Definition: Generators are defined using either:<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Generator Functions: Defined using the def keyword and yield statement.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Generator Expressions: Similar to list comprehensions but with parentheses instead of square brackets.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Example 1: Generator Function<br>\n",
    "A generator function uses the yield statement to return values one at a time. Each call to the generator’s __next__() method (or using it in a loop) resumes execution where it left off, right after the last yield statement.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "def countdown(n):<br>\n",
    "    while n > 0:<br>\n",
    "        yield n<br>\n",
    "        n -= 1<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "# Create a generator<br>\n",
    "gen = countdown(5)<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "# Iterate over the generator<br>\n",
    "for num in gen:<br>\n",
    "    print(num)<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "# Output:<br>\n",
    "# 5<br>\n",
    "# 4<br>\n",
    "# 3<br>\n",
    "# 2<br>\n",
    "# 1<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Example 2: Generator Expression<br>\n",
    "A generator expression is a concise way to create a generator on the fly, similar to list comprehensions.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "# Generator expression<br>\n",
    "gen_exp = (x * x for x in range(5))<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "# Iterate over the generator<br>\n",
    "for num in gen_exp:<br>\n",
    "    print(num)<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "# Output:<br>\n",
    "# 0<br>\n",
    "# 1<br>\n",
    "# 4<br>\n",
    "# 9<br>\n",
    "# 16<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?<br>\n",
    "Ans. Generators offer several advantages over regular functions, particularly in terms of memory efficiency and lazy evaluation. Here are some key benefits:<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Advantages of Using Generators:<br>\n",
    "Memory Efficiency: Generators produce items one at a time and only when requested, which means they don’t need to store the entire sequence in memory. This is especially useful for working with large datasets or streams of data.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Lazy Evaluation: Generators compute values on-the-fly, generating each value only when it is needed. This can lead to performance improvements by avoiding unnecessary computations and memory usage.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Infinite Sequences: Generators can represent infinite sequences, like the Fibonacci sequence, because they yield values one at a time without ever running out of memory.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Improved Readability: Using yield in generator functions can make the code easier to understand and manage, particularly for complex iterations.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Example:<br>\n",
    "Here’s an example illustrating the memory efficiency and lazy evaluation of generators:<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Generator Function:<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "def generate_numbers(n):<br>\n",
    "    for i in range(n):<br>\n",
    "        yield i<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "# Using the generator to generate numbers up to 1,000,000<br>\n",
    "numbers_generator = generate_numbers(1000000)<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "# Sum of all generated numbers<br>\n",
    "sum_numbers = sum(numbers_generator)<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "print(sum_numbers)  # Output: 499999500000<br>\n",
    "Regular Function:<br>\n",
    "For comparison, here’s how a regular function would handle the same task, which is much less memory efficient:<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "def generate_numbers_list(n):<br>\n",
    "    return [i for i in range(n)]<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "# Using the regular function to generate a list of numbers up to 1,000,000<br>\n",
    "numbers_list = generate_numbers_list(1000000)<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "# Sum of all numbers in the list<br>\n",
    "sum_numbers = sum(numbers_list)<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "print(sum_numbers)  # Output: 499999500000<br>\n",
    "Comparison:<br>\n",
    "Memory Usage: The generator function produces each number one at a time, requiring much less memory than the regular function, which creates a complete list in memory.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Efficiency: The generator is more efficient because it doesn't need to generate all numbers at once.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?<br>\n",
    "Ans. Definition: A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. Unlike regular functions defined with def, lambda functions can have any number of arguments but only one expression. The expression is evaluated and returned. Lambda functions are often used for short-term tasks that are simple and easily expressed in a single line of code.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Typical Usage: Lambda functions are typically used in situations where a simple function is needed for a short duration, such as:<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In-place function definitions: When you need a small function for a specific task.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Higher-order functions: Functions that take other functions as arguments, such as map(), filter(), and sorted().<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Example:<br>\n",
    "Here's an example of a lambda function used with the sorted() function to sort a list of tuples based on the second element of each tuple:<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "# List of tuples<br>\n",
    "data = [(1, 'apple'), (2, 'banana'), (3, 'cherry')]<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "# Sort the list of tuples based on the second element (the fruit name)<br>\n",
    "sorted_data = sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[1])<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "print(sorted_data)<br>\n",
    "Explanation:<br>\n",
    "Lambda Function: lambda x: x[1]<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Arguments: x is the argument.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Expression: x[1] is the expression, which returns the second element of the tuple.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "sorted() Function: The sorted() function uses the lambda function to determine the sort order based on the second element of each tuple.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.<br>\n",
    "Ans. Purpose: The map() function applies a specified function to each item in an iterable (such as a list or tuple) and returns an iterator with the results. It's used to transform or process the items in the iterable based on the logic defined in the function.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Usage: The map() function takes two arguments:<br>\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "# Function to square a number<br>\n",
    "def square(x):<br>\n",
    "    return x * x<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "# List of numbers<br>\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "# Applying the square function to each item in the list using map()<br>\n",
    "squared_numbers = map(square, numbers)<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "# Converting the map object to a list<br>\n",
    "squared_list = list(squared_numbers)<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "print(squared_list)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]<br>\n",
    "Explanation:<br>\n",
    "Function Definition: The square function takes a number x and returns its square.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "List of Numbers: A list numbers containing integers.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "map() Function: The map() function applies the square function to each item in the numbers list.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Iterator: map() returns an iterator. We convert it to a list to see the results.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Output: The resulting list [1, 4, 9, 16, 25] contains the squares of the original numbers.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?<br>\n",
    "Ans. Differences Between map(), reduce(), and filter() in Python<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "map() Function:<br>\n",
